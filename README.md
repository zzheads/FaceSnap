###About this Course

In this course we're going to build an app that is quite popular these days - a selfie app! We'll learn how to build and apply filters, how to use Core Data for more than just a single entity and how to use the device's camera to create a fun app!
What you'll learn

- [x] Core Data
- [x] Core Image and image rendering
- [x] Building apps without storyboards
- [x] Filtering data with predicates

>####Taking a Selfie
>An essential component of building a selfie app is allowing users to take pictures. There are several ways a user can end >up with a photo and over the next set of videos we use the UIImagePickerController class to build this functionality. We'll >revisit an important concept - delegates, and understand how we can build objects that are not tightly coupled from the get >go.

>####Adding Image Filters
>One of the fun parts of our app is applying filters to the images we taken. Over the next set of videos, let's take a look >at how we can apply various filters to an image and render it in a view. This isn't as simple as it seems and we'll look at >some of the pitfalls we may run into and the resulting considerations we need to make for a great user experience.

>####Adding Metadata to Photos
>Storing just a selfie in an app is easy so we're going to step it up a notch and add some metadata to each photo. Over the >next set of videos, we'll create an interface that allows users to add both a location and tags to the photo. Using this >metadata we can later build in useful filtering functionality.

####Saving and Displaying Selfies
>Now that we've finally built up the UI and logic to take a selfie and add metadata to it, let's implement the saving >functionality. Over the next few videos, we'll add Core Data Entities to represent the various aspects of our model, create >NSManagedObject subclasses to interact with them in code and save the photos to disk

####Filtering the Data
>There is no point to adding metadata to our photos if we're not going to use them in the app. Over the next set of videos, >let's implement some logic to allow a user to sort their main feed by tags. We'll do this using generic classes so they can >be reused for either a location, or future metadata types should we add them. Once we have a set of tags to sort by, we'll >reload the main screen dynamically!
